        <h1>The Writing Systems of Japanese</h1>
        <p>
            Japanese is written in a syllabic writing system called <i>kana</i>. The two <i>kana</i>
            systems are <i>hiragana</i> and <i>katakana</i>. Japanese is also written in <i>kanji</i>, 
            a writing script that was introduced into Japan from ancient China.
        </p>

        <p>While modern Japanese is written left to right and top to bottom like most languages, 
            It can still be written in its traditional way of top to bottom and right to left.
        </p>

        <h2><i>Hiragana</i> and <i>Katakana</i></h2>
        <p>
            The term <i>kana</i> itself literally means "borrowed characters". There are two types of <i>kana</i>:
            <i>Hiragana</i> and <i>katakana</i>.
        </p>

        <h3><i>Hiragana</i></h3>
        <p>
            <i>Hiragana</i> is used to write native Japanese words, Chinese borrowed words, and grammatical functions.
            Its rounder shapes and simple strokes distinguishes it from <i>katakana</i> and <i>kanji</i>.
            Knowing how to read and write <i>hiragana</i> is one of the first step of learning Japanese.
