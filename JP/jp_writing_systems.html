        <h1>The Writing Systems of Japanese</h1>
        <p>
            Japanese is written in a syllabic writing system called <i>kana</i>. The two <i>kana</i>
            systems are <i>hiragana</i> and <i>katakana</i>. Japanese is also written in <i>kanji</i>, 
            a writing script that was adopted into Japanese from ancient China.
        </p>

        <h2><i>Hiragana</i> and <i>Katakana</i></h2>
        <p>The term <i>kana</i> itself literally means "borrowed characters".</p>
